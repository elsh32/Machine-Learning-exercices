# Machine-Learning-exercices
My octave code when I was taking Andrew NG Machine learning class.
You will find in this folder my implementation from scratch of the following machine learning algorithm using octave :
	- Linear Regression
	- Logistic Regression
 	- Support Vector Machine
	- Neural Network (Forward Propagation and Backward propagation)
	- Support Vector Machine
	- Principal Component Analysis
	- Recommender System
